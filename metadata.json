  "description": "The Dowry Calculator is a satirical and educational website created to highlight the outdated and unethical practice of dowry in society. Using commonly cited social factors such as income, education, assets, and location, the calculator demonstrates how individuals are often unfairly “valued” in monetary terms during marriage negotiations.\n\nThis platform is not meant to promote dowry. On the contrary, it uses humor and irony to raise awareness about how irrational and harmful the concept of dowry truly is. The calculated amount is intentionally exaggerated to provoke thought and conversation.",
